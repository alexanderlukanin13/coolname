How to contribute
=================

Add more adjectives and nouns
-----------------------------

The more, the better - as long as names are cool!

Feel free to open a pull request for ``coolname/data`` files.
Or just send me an email with your suggestions.

If you find some words too sophisticated / not so cool / just plain wrong,
please let me know. English is my not native language, and I may have some
wrong ideas about words meaning and usage.
