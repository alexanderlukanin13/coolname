Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Why animals?
------------

- Animals are cool.

- Animals are culture-neutral.

- But, there is a long tradition of nicknaming people after animals in almost every culture.

- Animals are active (well, most of them), so they are more suitable for a human nickname.
  Plants or inanimate objects are too stationary.

Why some animals are not included?
----------------------------------

We shouldn't use too local, or hard-to-pronounce, or easy-to-confuse animal names.

For example, we have rejected:

- `possum` and `opossum` because they are easy to mix up both as words and as animals.

- `wallaroo` because we already have `wallaby` and `kangaroo`.

- `coralsnake` and `cottonmouth` because they look like adjective-nouns,
  not like "solid" nouns.

But we have accepted:

- `bee` and `honeybee`

- `dog` and `hound`

- `panther`, `puma` and `cougar`

because they are distinct and easy to remember. Practicality beats purity!

Why maximum 11 characters per word?
-----------------------------------

Default length of Django slug field is 50 characters. `adjective-adjective-noun-of-noun`
is exactly 50 characters if every word is 11 characters.

Also, we don't want too sophisticated words with too many syllables.

How do you select adjectives?
-----------------------------

Adjective should be positive, fun and not too complex.

Adjectives shouldn't be culture-specific.
