Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Why animals?
------------

- Animals are cool.

- Animals are culture-neutral.

- But, there is a long tradition of nicknaming people after animals in almost every culture.

- Animals are active (well, most of them), so they are more suitable for a human nickname.
  Plants or inanimate objects are too stationary.

Why some animals are not included?
----------------------------------

We shouldn't use too local, or hard-to-pronounce, or easy-to-confuse animal names.

For example, we have rejected:

- *possum* and *opossum* because they are easy to mix up both as words and as animals.

- *wallaroo* because we already have *wallaby* and *kangaroo*.

- *coralsnake* and *cottonmouth* because they look like adjective-nouns,
  not like "solid" nouns.

But we have accepted:

- *bee* and *honeybee*

- *dog* and *hound*

- *panther*, *puma* and *cougar*

because they are distinct and easy to remember. Practicality beats purity!

What is the maximum length?
---------------------------

For default generator, hard limit is 13 characters, to allow certain words like *sophisticated*.

Most words are 11 characters or less, and contain 4 syllables or less.

Maximum slug length is 50 characters, which is consistent with Django.

How do you select adjectives?
-----------------------------

Adjective should be positive, fun and not too complex.

Adjectives shouldn't be culture-specific.

I don't like animals. Can I create my own theme?
------------------------------------------------

Sure, and it's easy. Check out README for details.
